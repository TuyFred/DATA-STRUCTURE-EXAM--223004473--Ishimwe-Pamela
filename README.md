# Online Pharmacy for Medicine Delivery

## Project Description
The Online Pharmacy for Medicine Delivery project aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly system for ordering and delivering medicines. It leverages advanced data structures and algorithms to manage and process data, ensuring fast and reliable service. The project integrates technologies such as Python and various data structures to optimize operations like order management, inventory tracking, and delivery prioritization.

## Topics Implemented

### Topic 1: Importance of Data Structures
Efficient data structures are critical for managing medicine orders, inventory, and customer information. This project explores their importance in ensuring smooth operations.

### Topic 2: Doubly Linked List and Binary Tree
- **Doubly Linked List:** Used to dynamically manage customer orders, enabling seamless addition and removal of orders.
- **Binary Tree:** Organizes medicines hierarchically for efficient retrieval and categorization.

### Topic 3: AVL Tree for Processing
- Implements an AVL Tree to maintain balanced data for fast retrieval and updates, especially for urgent medicine orders.

### Topic 4: Heap for Fixed-Order Management
- Utilizes a Heap to prioritize and manage a fixed number of urgent orders, ensuring critical deliveries are handled first.

### Topic 5: Dynamic Tracking with Doubly Linked List
- Tracks inventory and fluctuating order volumes dynamically to ensure real-time updates and minimize delays.

### Topic 6: Hierarchical Representation with Trees
- Represents hierarchical data, such as medicine categories, manufacturers, and availability, using tree structures for an intuitive and organized interface.

### Topic 7: Heap Sort for Prioritization
- Implements Heap Sort to prioritize medicine orders based on urgency and deadlines, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.
